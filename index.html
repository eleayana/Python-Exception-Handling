<h1>Python Notes</h1>
<h2> Why should we learn Python?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very easy to learn with smooth syntax.</li>
  <li> Code can be developed quickly</li>
  <li>Interpreted language , no Compilation needed</li>
  <li>Plenty of Job Opportunities if they have skills in Python</li>
  <li> Used heavenly in some areas ie ML,DS,SC.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Python Coding Skills</h2>
<h3>i. Intermediate Skills</h3>
<h4>a)Exception Handling</h4>
<p1>Exception means error detected at the time of program execution.</p1>
<p2>However , while running a program , python generates an exception that should be handled to avoid your program to crash.</p2>
<p>Examples:(Division by Zero,Addition of Two incompatible types, Accessing a file which doesn't exist).</p>
<h3>Syntax:</h3>
<pre>
try:
     #Code to execute
except:
      Code to execute in case of Errors
 else: 
     Code to execute in case of No Error
finally:
       code to execute in all cases
       </pre>
<h4>1st case: You are driving the road & the road is clear & you reach your destination without any trouble. This is called executing a program without exceptions.</h4>
<h4> 2nd case: You are driving on the road and you see the accident on the road what you didn't expect to happen called exception.And your action of taking detour called Handling Exeptions.</h4>
<h4> Syntax:</h4>
<pre>
try:
    while road_is_clear()
          drive()
except: Accident as e:
           take_detour()
</pre>
<pre>
#Code1:
1/0
∴Output:ERROR
ZeroDivisionError:division by Zero

#Code2:
x = input("Enter a no:5")
y = input("Enter a no:8")
z = int(x)/int(y)
print("Division is :", z)
∴ Output: Division is 13

#Code 3:
x = input("Enter a no:5")
y = input("Enter a no:8")
try:
    z= int(x) / int(y)
except Exception as e:
    print('Exception occured:',e)
    z = None
 print("Division is:",z)
 ∴ Output: Division is:None
 
 #Code 4:
x = input("Enter a no:5")
y = input("Enter a no:8")
try:
   z = x / int(y)
except ZerodivisionError as e:
      print('Division by ZeroException')
      Z = None
print("Division is:",z)
∴ Output: ERROR
</pre>
<h5>#How to raise an exception</h5>
<pre>
try:
    raise MemoryError('memory error')
except MemoryError as e:
print(e)
∴ Output: Memory Error
</pre>

# Class Accident(Exception)
<pre>
 class Accident(Exception):
    def __init__(self, msg):
         self.msg = msg
    def print_exception(self):
       print("Userdefined Exception:")
try: 
    raise Accident("Crash between 2 cars")
except Accident as e:
    e.print_exception()
    print(e)
∴ Output:Userdefined Exception:Crash between  2 cars
